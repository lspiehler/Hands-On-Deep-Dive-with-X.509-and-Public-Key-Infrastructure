## Course Abstract  

### Title:  
Hands-On Deep Dive with X.509 and Public Key Infrastructure

### Keywords:  
PKI, asymmetric cryptography, hashing, encryption

### Instructor:  
Lyas Spiehler – Systems Architect at Sapphire Health, developer of certificatetools.com and PKIaaS.io with 10 years of experience supporting infrastructure within the healthcare industry.

### Prerequisites:  
•	Experience working from the command line  
•	Basic IT, networking and OS knowledge

### Audience:  
Developers, network and server administrators

### Objectives:  
•	Learn the fundamentals of asymmetric cryptography, hashing, X.509, and PKI  
•	Build a trust model by hand using only OpenSSL  
•	Avoid common mistakes made during deployment and implementation  
•	Become familiar with PKCS#11 and HSMs through hands-on learning with Yubikeys  
•	Leverage all of the use-cases PKI offers to secure your infrastructure and applications  
•	Use ACME and SCEP to automate certificate issuance and renewal  
•	Understand how enhancements like HSTS and OCSP stapling complement HTTPS  
•	Learn the importance of code signing and protecting your root trust store  
•	Explore revocation with CRL and OCSP and recognize the strengths/weaknesses of each  
•	Understand certificate transparency and how it is used  
•	Use certificate authentication to overcome weaknesses in many 2FA implementations  
•	Troubleshoot SSL/TLS and STARTTLS for any protocol using OpenSSL

### Summary:  
Public Key Infrastructure is highly misunderstood by many developers, engineers and administrators. It is often implemented using weak cryptographic algorithms, with no regard for protection of private keys, and frequently in ways that force users to ignore warnings designed to protect them. This course will teach you all of the nuances of asymmetric cryptography and PKI. We will explore the certificate life cycle, key management, revocation including CRL and OCSP, automation, HSMs, which algorithms are secure and which are not, and much more. You’ll have a deeper knowledge of how PKI can and should be used to secure your applications and infrastructure. We will begin with the fundamentals of asymmetric cryptography, discover how it differs from symmetric encryption, understand how hashing works and the different kinds of encryption and hashing algorithms. We will explore X.509 and PKI with a vendor-agnostic approach using OpenSSL so that you’ll build the foundational knowledge necessary to be able to competently leverage any vendor implementation of PKI.
